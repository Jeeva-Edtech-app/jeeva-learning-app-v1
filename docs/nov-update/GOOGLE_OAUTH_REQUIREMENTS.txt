Implement Google Sign-In authentication for the Jeeva Learning mobile app using Supabase OAuth.

CONTEXT:
- This is a React Native mobile app for Indian nurses preparing for UK NMC CBT exam
- Backend uses Supabase for authentication and database
- Need to support Google OAuth login alongside email/password

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Supabase Auth with OAuth provider: 'google'
- Deep link redirect URL: jeevalearning://auth/callback
- Install required packages for React Native Google Sign-In
- Support both iOS and Android platforms

IMPLEMENTATION NEEDED:

1. Install Dependencies:
   - @react-native-google-signin/google-signin (or equivalent for Expo)
   - Configure deep linking for OAuth callback

2. Create Google Sign-In Function:
   - Add signInWithGoogle() to auth context/hook
   - Use supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })
   - Handle redirect with deep link callback
   - Create/update user profile after successful authentication

3. Update Login Screen:
   - Add "Sign in with Google" button
   - Implement Google sign-in flow
   - Show loading states during authentication
   - Handle errors gracefully

4. User Profile Handling:
   - After Google auth, check if user_profiles record exists
   - If new user, create profile with Google data (name, email, avatar)
   - If existing user, update last_login timestamp
   - Navigate to appropriate screen (onboarding or home)

5. Deep Linking Setup:
   - Configure app scheme: jeevalearning://
   - Handle auth/callback route for OAuth redirect
   - Extract tokens from redirect URL
   - Complete authentication flow

SUPABASE SETUP (Already Done on Backend):
- Supabase project URL: Use SUPABASE_URL from environment
- Supabase anon key: Use SUPABASE_ANON_KEY from environment
- Google OAuth is enabled in Supabase dashboard
- Redirect URLs are configured

EXPECTED USER FLOW:
Login Screen → Click "Google Sign In" → Open Google OAuth → User authenticates → Redirect to app → Create/update profile → Navigate to home/onboarding

ERROR HANDLING:
- OAuth cancellation by user
- Network errors during authentication
- Invalid/expired tokens
- Profile creation failures

Please implement this with proper TypeScript types, error handling, and follow React Native best practices.

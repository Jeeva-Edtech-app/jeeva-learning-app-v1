# Mobile App Payment Gateway Integration

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

The Jeeva Learning platform now has a complete dual payment gateway system with smart routing:
- **Stripe** for UK/international users
- **Razorpay** for Indian users (0% fees on UPI!)

## 📁 What's Been Built

### Backend Services
- ✅ **Stripe Service** (`server/services/stripe.ts`) - Payment intents, customers, webhooks
- ✅ **Razorpay Service** (`server/services/razorpay.ts`) - Orders, customers, signature verification
- ✅ **Payment API** (`src/api/payments.ts`) - Database operations for payments
- ✅ **Unified Service** (`server/services/payment.ts`) - Smart routing and subscription integration
- ✅ **Express Endpoints** (`server/routes/payments.ts`) - API routes for payments
- ✅ **Database Schema** - 5 tables for payments, customers, methods, refunds, webhooks

### Mobile Integration Guides
- ✅ **Stripe Integration Guide** - React Native setup with Expo
- ✅ **Razorpay Integration Guide** - UPI, cards, net banking, wallets
- ✅ **Smart Routing Guide** - Country-based gateway selection
- ✅ **Testing Guide** - Test cards, flows, webhooks
- ✅ **Environment Setup** - API keys and secrets configuration

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Get API Keys

You'll need to sign up for both payment gateways:

**Stripe** (for UK/international)
1. Sign up at [stripe.com](https://stripe.com)
2. Get your API keys from Dashboard → Developers → API Keys
3. You'll need: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

**Razorpay** (for India)
1. Sign up at [razorpay.com](https://razorpay.com)
2. Get your API keys from Settings → API Keys
3. You'll need: `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` and `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`

### 2. Add Secrets to Replit

1. Click the **Secrets** tab in Replit (🔒 lock icon)
2. Add these secrets:

```
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=rzp_test_...
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=...
```

### 3. Restart Server

Once secrets are added:
1. Restart the workflow (or server will auto-restart)
2. You should see: `✅ API server running on port 3001`
3. Payment API will be available at `/api/payments`

### 4. Apply Database Migration

Run this migration to create payment tables:

```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f database/migrations/create_payment_system.sql
```

This creates:
- `payment_customers` - Gateway customer records
- `payment_methods` - Saved payment methods
- `payments` - Payment transactions
- `payment_refunds` - Refund records
- `payment_webhook_events` - Webhook event log

### 5. Give Mobile Integration Guides to Your Team

Share these guides with your React Native mobile development team:

📄 **Must Read:**
- `stripe-integration.md` - Stripe setup for UK/international users
- `razorpay-integration.md` - Razorpay setup for Indian users
- `smart-routing-guide.md` - Auto-routing based on country
- `manual-gateway-selection.md` - Let users choose their gateway (optional)
- `testing-guide.md` - How to test payments

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Smart Routing Logic

**Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)**
```
User Location
    ↓
Country Detection (IN, GB, US, etc.)
    ↓
Gateway Selection
    ├── India (IN) → Razorpay (UPI 0% fees)
    └── Others → Stripe (global cards)
    ↓
Payment Processing
    ↓
Subscription Activation
```

**Option 2: Manual Selection with Smart Defaults**
```
User Location
    ↓
Country Detection → Pre-select Gateway
    ↓
User sees recommended gateway
    ↓
User can switch if desired
    ↓
Payment Processing with chosen gateway
    ↓
Subscription Activation
```

Both options work with the same backend API - just pass `gatewayOverride` parameter for manual selection.

### Payment Flow

```
1. Mobile app calls: POST /api/payments/create
   → Backend creates Stripe/Razorpay payment
   → Returns clientSecret/orderId

2. Mobile app opens payment UI
   → Stripe Payment Sheet OR Razorpay Checkout
   → User completes payment

3. Mobile app calls: POST /api/payments/verify
   → Backend verifies payment
   → Activates subscription
   → Returns success

4. Webhook confirms payment (backup)
   → POST /api/payments/webhooks/stripe
   → POST /api/payments/webhooks/razorpay
   → Updates payment status
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### payment_customers
Stores gateway customer records per user

### payments
Main payment transactions table with gateway-specific IDs

### payment_refunds
Refund records linked to original payments

### payment_methods
Saved payment methods (for future recurring payments)

### payment_webhook_events
Log of all webhook events for debugging

## 🔐 Security

### ✅ What's Protected
- Secret keys never exposed to mobile app
- Payment intents created on backend only
- Signature verification for all webhooks
- RLS policies on payment tables
- HTTPS for all API calls

### ⚠️ Important Notes
- Never commit API keys to Git
- Use test keys in development
- Rotate keys if compromised
- Monitor webhook delivery rates

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Cards (Stripe)
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- 3D Secure: `4000 0025 0000 3155`
- Declined: `4000 0000 0000 9995`

### Test UPI (Razorpay)
- UPI ID: `success@razorpay`
- Outcome: Payment succeeds

### Test Flow
1. Select subscription plan
2. App detects country (IN or GB)
3. Routes to appropriate gateway
4. Complete payment with test credentials
5. Verify subscription activates

See `testing-guide.md` for comprehensive test scenarios.
